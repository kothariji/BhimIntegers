# BhimIntegers
### An Implementation of BigInteger library in C++
![Banner](https://github.com/kothariji/BhimIntegers/blob/master/Bhim%20Integers.jpg?raw=true)

### BhimIntegers is a C++ library which is useful when we are dealing with BigIntegers. We can handle big integers (integers having size bigger than the long long int data type) and we can perform arithmetic operations like addition, multiplication, subtraction, division, equality check, etc. Also there are several functions like factorial, reverse. We can check that a number is a palindromic number, counting occurrences, etc. It has some conversion option to convert a string to bhimInteger etc. Overall this library is very useful for computing large results.


# Usage
#### Download the "BhimInteger.h" header .Then #include it inside your code:
```c++
#include "BhimInteger.h"   // the actual path may vary
```
# Declaring A Variable
```c++
    BhimInteger n1;                                             //n1 defined with value 0
    BhimInteger n2(123);                                        //n2 defined with value int value
    BhimInteger n3((long long int)1234567898765432);            //n3 defined with value long long int value
    BhimInteger n4("7832467326423873423435");                   //n4 defined with string value
    BhimInteger n5(n3);   
```

# Converting to BhimNumbers
```c++
    int num1 = -321;
    long long int num2 = -9876543219876543;
    string str1 = "-2112321321321312421534365777";
    BhimInteger n6 = to_Bhim(num1);                              //converting int to BhimInteger
    BhimInteger n7 = to_Bhim(num2);                              //converting long long int to BhimInteger
    BhimInteger n8 = to_Bhim(str1);                              //converting string to BhimInteger
```
 
 # Arithmatic Operations
 ```c++
    cout<<"Addition: "<<n1+n2<<endl;                             //Addition
    cout<<"Subtraction: "<<n2-n1<<endl;                          //subtraction
    cout<<"Multiplication: "<<n1*n2<<endl;                       //Multiplication
    cout<<"Division: "<<n4/n2<<endl;                             //Division

    cout<<"n2 + 5: "<<n2+5<<endl;
    cout<<"n2 - 5: "<<n2-5<<endl;
    cout<<"n2 * 5: "<<n2*5<<endl;
    cout<<"n2 / 5: "<<n2/5<<endl;

    cout<<"5 + n2: "<<5+n2<<endl;
    cout<<"5 - n2: "<<5-n2<<endl;
    cout<<"5 * n2: "<<5*n2<<endl;
    cout<<"5 / n2: "<<5/n2<<endl;
```

# Other Operations

### unary operations
```c++
    cout<<"PreIncrement: "<<++n2<<endl;
    cout<<"PreDecrement: "<<--n2<<endl;
    cout<<"PostIncrement: "<<n2++<<endl;
    cout<<"PostDecrement: "<<n2--<<endl;
```
### equality check
```c++
    cout<<"Check n3 != n5: "<<(bool)(n3 != n5)<<endl;            //Checking if value of both are different
    cout<<"Check n3 == n5: "<<(bool)(n3 == n5)<<endl;            //Checking if value of both are same
```
### few other operators
```c++
    n3 += n2;
    cout<<"n3 += n2: "<<n3<<endl;

    n3 -= n2;
    cout<<"n3 -= n2: "<<n3<<endl;

    n3 *= n2;
    cout<<"n3 *= n2: "<<n3<<endl;

    n3 /= n2;
    cout<<"n3 /= n2: "<<n3<<endl;
```


# Functions
```c++
    cout<<"Maximum: "<<maxBhim(n1, n2)<<endl;                               //Maximum of two Numbers
    cout<<"Minimum: "<<minBhim(n1, n2)<<endl;                               //Minimum of two Numbers
    cout<<"absolute: "<<absBhim(n1)<<" "<<absBhim(n2)<<endl;                //Absolute value of a number
    cout<<"Factorial: "<<factBhim(n1)<<" "<<factBhim(n2)<<endl;             //Factorial of a number
    cout<<"Reverse: "<<revBhim(n3)<<endl;                                   //Reverse a number
    cout<<"Counting the occurance of a digit: "<<countBhim(n9,6)<<endl;     //Counting the occurance of a digit
    cout<<"Erasing all occurance of a digit: "<<eraseBhim(n9,4)<<endl;      //Erasing all occurances of a digit
    cout<<"isPaliBhim: "<<(bool)isPaliBhim(n9)<<endl;                       //Checking if a number is palindrome
    cout<<"sorting the digits: "<<sortBhim(n9)<<endl;                       //sort the digits of a number
	cout<<"Finds power: "<<powBhim(n3, n2)<<endl;                           //finds x to the power y, where x and y is any int. Returns Integer value in form of string
